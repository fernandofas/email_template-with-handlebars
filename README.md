# Email Template using Gulp, Sass and Handlebars


## Installation

Download the files in a folder, open the folder in your code editor and type

```npm install```


## Usage

Change the partials as you need it and place all the css in the sass file called inline.css.

Open the browser on localhost:3000 and voila.

## Final build

The final build will be inside the "dist" folder.

The data.json file is placed in the "dist" folder as well and the tags in the html file just in case you need to build an email template with dynamic content. You can delete it if you wish.

Some email platforms allow you to use dynamic content for emails.
